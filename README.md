# Automate-Wordpress-Setup

This project automates the setup of a virtual development environment for WordPress using Vagrant. It provisions an Ubuntu-based virtual machine with a fully configured LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and WordPress. The configuration includes setting up a private and public network, allocating resources, and automating the installation of required software, database setup, and WordPress deployment. This ensures a consistent, reproducible, and ready-to-use environment for WordPress development or testing.
